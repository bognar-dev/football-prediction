\section{Introduction}

In this paper I will in examine the impact of neural networks in sport prediction algorithms, measuring the performance on a football dataset.
Neural networks, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), have the ability to learn complex nonlinear relationships and patterns in data. In sports prediction tasks, where outcomes may be influenced by numerous factors with intricate interactions, neural networks can potentially capture these complex patterns more effectively than simpler algorithms.
First we will explore other algorithms for predicting the outcome of a football match, then we will compare them within and with the neural network approach.
I will use python and especially the \href{https://scikit-learn.org/}{scikit} for the implementation of algorithms.
